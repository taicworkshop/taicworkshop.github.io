### 14:45-15:45  
**Invited Guest Talk**  
**Speaker**: Giulio Rossolini  
**Title**: *“Are Adversarial Attacks Still Useful for Safety-Oriented Robustness Evaluation of AI Systems?”*

**Abstract**: Beyond adversarial machine learning in secure AI, adversarial attacks are commonly treated as worst-case tests for safety-oriented robustness evaluation of machine learning models. However, in practical AI systems, safety is governed not only by the existence of extreme failure cases, but also by their probability and system-level impact. This talk challenges the implicit equivalence between adversarial robustness and safety. Building on the well-known observation that adversarial attacks and stochastic perturbations probe distinct failure mechanisms, we show that analyzing the relationship between adversarial and perturbation robustness—through the use of probabilistic risk metrics—leads to a more nuanced interpretation of robustness evaluation. In this perspective, we highlight that adversarial attacks remain valuable for exposing local model fragilities, but they should not be treated as universal worst-case safety oracles. This view motivates a shift toward perturbation-aware AI robustness evaluations and countermeasures in cyber-physical systems, moving beyond simple adversarial attack success rates.
